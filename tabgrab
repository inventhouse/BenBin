usage: tabgrab [-h|--help] [-c|--copy] [BROWSER]
       Collect tabs from all windows as a markdown list of links with
       the first tab of each window as the parent of the remaining tabs.
       BROWSER defaults to the BROWSER_APP environment variable, otherwise
       the default handler for 'https' is used to guess the system browser.

       -c, --copy    Copies the list to the pasteboard

       -n, --num-windows N
                     Collects tabs from the first N windows, defaults to
                     all windows

       -h, --help    Print this message and exit
